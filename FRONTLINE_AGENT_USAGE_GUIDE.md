## Why Am I Getting "No Verified Information"?

If you see the message: *"I don't have verified information about this topic in our knowledge base..."*

**This means:**
- The knowledge base doesn't contain information about your question
- You need to upload relevant documents first

**Solutions:**
1. **Upload relevant documents** - Add documents that contain the information you're asking about
2. **Rephrase your question** - Try using different keywords
3. **Check document content** - Make sure your uploaded documents contain the information
4. **Add FAQs** - Create FAQ entries in the system (if you have admin access)

## Best Practices

### For Better Answers:
1. **Upload comprehensive documentation**
   - Company policies
   - Product manuals
   - FAQ documents
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Procedures and workflows

2. **Use clear, specific questions**
   - Instead of: "How do I do this?"
   - Try: "How do I reset my password?"
   - Instead of: "What about payments?"
   - Try: "What payment methods do you accept?"

3. **Upload documents in order of importance**
   - Most frequently asked questions first
   - General policies and procedures
   - Specific technical documentation

### Document Upload Tips:
- **PDF files**: Best for formatted documents (manuals, policies)
- **DOCX files**: Good for editable documents
- **TXT/MD files**: Simple text documents
- **HTML files**: Web-based documentation

### Question Formatting:
- Use complete sentences
- Be specific about what you're asking
- Include relevant keywords
- Avoid very short questions (less than 3 words)

## Troubleshooting

### Agent keeps saying "No verified information"
- **Solution**: Upload documents related to your question
- **Check**: Are documents processed? (Look for "Indexed" badge)
- **Verify**: Does the document content match your question topic?

### Documents not uploading
- **Check file size**: Maximum 10MB
- **Check file format**: Must be PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, or HTML
- **Check permissions**: Make sure you're logged in as a company user

### Answers are not accurate
- **Review document content**: Make sure documents contain correct information
